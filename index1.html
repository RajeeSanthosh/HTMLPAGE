  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p> The world is the totality of entities, the whole of reality, or everything that exists.[1] 
  The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. 
  Some conceptions see the world as unique while others talk of a "plurality of worlds".
   Some treat the world as one simple object while others analyze the world as a complex made up of parts.

<p>World is beautiful</p>
